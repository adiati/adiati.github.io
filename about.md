Well this is embarrassing... I don't like talking about me. Plus I am 90% sure I don't have the commitment for a blog, so this will probably appear on the internet without edit for a while... possibly forever.

So yeah, I am someone who's interested in science, analysis, progress, humanity. Basically I have so few interests outside a core set, that 90% of what I'm interested in is derived from it being of interest for other people, and I find it really hard to have conversations with people, so what better way than to overthink their own interests and bore the heck out of them!
